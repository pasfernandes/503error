<p>The internet provides the billions around the world with access to all of the information that they could possibly think of looking up. However, as it goes with technology, it doesn't always operate in the manner that we always expect it to, flawless. It has problems, complications, updates, and when these problems arise, we are reminded, that the internet is handled by individuals who are knowledgeable enough to operate the necessary systems in keeping it fully functioning. Sometimes, in maintaining the internet, certain maintenance is required, resulting in a website to shut down for a certain amount of time.</p>
<p><br />When the phrase <strong>"503 error"</strong> is displayed across the screen, many are unclear of exactly what this message means.<br />The internet will sometimes not always bring up website pagesWhile the internet is seen as a perfect searching entity, it has it's complications just like anything else in this technological world. It's easy to forget that while we're sitting at our desks, or at our own personal home computers looking through social networks, or researching information, we're not the only ones who are viewing these sites, let alone, the only ones using the internet. It's easy to forget that while we're plugged into the internet, we're plugged in with everyone else in this world.</p>
<p>Here, the internet isn't measured by time, but space. The more space that is being taken up, for instance, the number of viewers per website, can cause the site to be overwhelmed in it's functioning capabilities. Each website is automatically programmed to handle only so much traffic before it shuts itself down for any necessary repairs, or to simply allow time for the traffic to decrease. A website can shut down for this reason, or it can shut down because the operators of the website are performing repairs to it. These repairs include fixing any HTML coding, software updates, designing and/or content changes, remedying any viruses on the site, etc. These changes and repairs can only be done when the website itself has been shut down. In order to inform the entire population that the site is down without going to heavily into detail, the message "503 error" will be displayed across the screen.</p>

<p><br />Many of us have come across weird codes and messages in the forms of letters and numbers. Not many of them make sense to the general populous, unless they have a degree in computers or a working knowledge of computers. The internet itself is broken down in codes and messages that are displayed for various reasons. In this particular case, the 5xx codes simply mean that the server itself has failed to carry out and complete a valid request. Currently, there are ten 5xx codes, the first one starting out at 500, the last ending in 510. <strong>503 error means that the service of accessing said website is currently unavailable</strong>, and that in due time, the website will be back up and functional again.</p>
<p>Typically, when this message is displayed across the screen, a person may find themselves banging their hands against their computer or desk, screaming profusely at the screen, trying to understand what the problem is. Some have gone as far as to call their internet service providers to demand an answer for why they are not able to access a certain page. Accessing a page that has a 503 error code is not the fault of the internet service provider. Their only role in this is to provide the internet service to their customers, and that's it. The only time that the internet service providers get involved is when the actual internet service has gone down completely, and no one of their customers can access anything.</p>
<p><br /><strong>The 503 error code means the webpage is temporarily down after all of the countless amounts of strewn anger and frustration by people who come victim to a 503 error code,</strong> it's best they realize, there's nothing they can really about it. Due to the above listed reasons as to why a 503 error appears, it's not too common that the administrators of the website will give a timeline in which to expect the site back up and running again.</p>
<p>In some cases, administrators have warned individuals ahead of time about services that will be conducted on the website. They will announce the date, followed by the times in which the services will be taking place. Most websites that do this are social networks, banks, credit cards, lending services, etc., generally places that deal with a great flow of people who use their services a great deal throughout their day, and their using the website it detrimental to their personal life. This heads to people is given to them if not a week in advance, then it's given to them a couple of days within the actual date of servicing. Most times, these services will take up to eight to twelve hours to complete, starting after 12am, long after people have gone to sleep. In the situation where these updates and services are completed before the expected time, the site will automatically become active again.</p>
<p><br />It's typically hard to understand when a 503 error is going to occur. Not even the administrators will always know when is going to happen, as it's unplanned for them when it's not planned. This has been the hardest part for both administrator and user of the website. As the administrators want to make sure that patrons keep coming to their websites, they do all they can to make sure that they have little to no 503 errors. Should one arise, they work expeditiously to resolve whatever the situation is and get the site back up and running again.</p>
